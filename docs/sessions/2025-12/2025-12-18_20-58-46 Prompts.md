# Session Prompts

**Date:** 2025-12-18
**Session:** Skills/Agents Architecture Implementation

---

## User Prompts (in sequence)

1. `status`

2. `are you there`

3. `ok what is next step. Given the initial effort in the plan was more monolithic and the goal is to build out the capabilities using skills and agents and or subagents, what is that next step`

4. `ok let's begin phase 1`

5. `what is phase 2`

6. `yes start phase 2`

7. `let's test first`

8. `let's start phase 3`

9. `yes` (to proceed with Phase 4)

10. `yes` (to start Phase 5)

11. `/q-end-session`

## Notable Patterns

### Architecture Direction Prompts
- Prompt #3 effectively pivoted the project from monolithic to modular architecture
- Concise but clear about goals (skills, agents, subagents)

### Phase Progression
- Simple "yes" and "let's start" prompts to advance through phases
- Explicit "let's test first" to validate before moving forward

### Useful Reusable Prompts
- "what is phase X" - Good for getting overview before committing
- "let's test first" - Validates work before proceeding
- "ok let's begin phase X" - Clear phase initiation
