## Chronological Log

### 1. User: `/q-end-session`
**Action:** Attempted to run end-session workflow, but was interrupted.

### 2. User: `/q-init`
**Action:** Ran project initialization command. Checked if `docs/sessions/` folder exists (it did not). Created the following folder structure:
- `/docs/`
- `/docs/sessions/`
- `/docs/reference/`
- `/test-data/`
- `/scripts/`

Created template files:
- `PLAN.md` - Project planning document
- `COMPLETED_PLAN.md` - Archive for completed steps
- `docs/reference/CLI-REFERENCE.md` - Detailed CLI documentation
- `docs/reference/CLI-QUICKREF.md` - Quick command reference
- `docs/reference/CLI-TESTING.md` - Test documentation

### 3. User: "Look at @PLANtom.md and decide what things need to stay as a plan"
**Action:** Read PLANtom.md (2040 lines) and assessed its content. Found it was ~95% implementation specification (Python code Parts 1-9) and only ~5% actual planning content (Implementation Checklist, Future Integration section). Recommended restructuring:
- Move implementation code to a spec document
- Keep PLAN.md focused on task tracking with phases/steps

### 4. User: "Yes but retain the file name PLANtom.md"
**Action:** Proposed a restructured PLANtom.md with:
- Current Status section
- Phase 1: Core Implementation (Steps 1.1-1.8)
- Phase 2: Testing & Documentation
- Phase 3: Skill Extraction (Future)
- Phase 4: Writer's Portal Integration (Future)
- Quick Reference table

Also proposed creating EMBEDDING_ANALYZER_SPEC.md for all implementation details.

### 5. User: "Yes implement the restructure"
**Action:** Created todo list to track progress. Discovered EMBEDDING_ANALYZER_SPEC.md already existed with different content (older/general spec). Created new file `RHETORIC_ANALYZER_SPEC.md` with all implementation code from PLANtom.md (Parts 1-9, dependencies, testing commands, future integration notes). Rewrote PLANtom.md as a planning document with phases and sub-tasks.

### 6. User: "I want to merge plan.md and PLANtom.md using the structure of plan.md"
**Action:** Read both files and assessed compatibility:
- PLAN.md: Template with Overview, Current Status, Steps (Purpose, Status, Sub-tasks, Deliverables, Notes), Quick Reference
- PLANtom.md: Phase-based structure with sub-tasks

Determined merge was possible. Offered two options:
- Option A: Phases become top-level Steps (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Option B: Keep as separate project plans

### 7. User: "Option A, merge them now"
**Action:**
1. Merged PLANtom.md content into PLAN.md structure:
   - Added Overview with project description and spec reference
   - Converted 4 phases to 4 steps
   - Added Deliverables and Notes sections to each step
   - Preserved Key Design Decisions section
   - Updated Quick Reference table
2. Deleted PLANtom.md

### 8. User: `/q-end-session`
**Action:** Started end-session workflow:
1. Created learnings file: `docs/sessions/2025-12/2025-12-17_11-24-24 Learnings.md`
2. Creating this dev log file
3. Will continue with prompts, PLAN.md update check, and commit prompt
